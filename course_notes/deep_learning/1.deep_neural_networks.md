## Deep Neural Networks
### Backpropagation
- In a nutshell, backpropagation will consist of:
  - Doing a feedforward operation.
  - Comparing the output of the model with the desired output.
  - Calculating the error.
  - Running the feedforward operation backwards (backpropagation) to spread the error to each of the weights.
  - Use this to update the weights, and get a better model.
  - Continue this until we have a model that is good.
