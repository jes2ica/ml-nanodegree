### Perceptrons

- Threshold Meditation
  - The main advantage of having a threshold be set to a perceptron is being able control when a perceptron should fire and when it shouldn't. 
  - This gives us control on the `sensitivity of our neurons` thereby helping us influence the desired output.

- Parameters
  - Modifiable: thresholds, weights
  - Non-modifiable: input values, input functions(dot-product for strength), output functions
  
- Inputs
  - A matrix of numerical values with classifications for each row
