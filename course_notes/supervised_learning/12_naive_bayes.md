### Bayes Rule
- Example
	- P(C) = 0.01
	- TEST: 
		- 90% it is positive if you have C. (Sensitivity)
		- 90% it is negative if you don't have C. (Specitivity)
	- Question: TEST = POSIVE 

- prior probability * test evidence -> posterior probability
	- Prior P(c) = 1%,
	- Posterior: P(C|Pos) = P(C) * P(Pos|C), P(!C|Pos) = P(!C) * P(Pos|!C)
