## Regressions in sklearn
- Minimizing the Sum of Squared Errors
  - ordinary least squares (OLS): used in sklearn LinearRegression.
  - gradient descent
- Sum of Squared Errors(SSE) isn't perfect.
  - If you add more data, SSE will go up.
- R squared
  - "How much of my change in the output (y) is explained by the change in my input (x)."
  - 0.0 < r^2 < 1.0 (line does a good job!)
- Multi-variate regression
