## Feature Scaling
- Formula
  - x' = (x - x_min) / (x_max - x_min)
  - 0 <= x' <= 1
- Algorithms

- Decision Trees use vertical and horizontal lines so there is no trade off. 
- SVM with RBF Kernel requires making trade-offs in dimensions. 
- In linear regression, the coefficient and the feature always go together.
- K-Means Clustering requires making trade-offs in dimensions. 
- Algorithms in which two dimensions affect the  outcome will be affected by rescaling.
