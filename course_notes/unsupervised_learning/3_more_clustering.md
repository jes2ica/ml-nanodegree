- Single Linkage Clustering (SLC)
  - Consider each object a cluster.
  - Define intercluster distance as the distance between the closest two points in the two clusters.
  - Merge two closest clusters.
  - Repeat n-k times to make n clusters.
- Running Time of SLC
  - Repeat k times(n/2)
  - look at all distances to find closest pair O(n^2) that have different labels.
- Soft Clustering
  - Assume the data was generated by:
    - Select one of k gaussians [fixed known variance] uniformly.
    - Sample x_i from that Gaussian
    - Repeat n times
  - Task:
    - Find a hypothesis h = <u1, u2, ... uk> that maximizes the probability of the data (ML).
- Propoties of EM
  - Monotonically non-decreasing likelihood.
  - Does not converge (partially does).
  - Will not diverge.
  - Can get stuck. => random restart.
  - Works with any distribution (if E, M solvable).
- Clustering properties
  - Richness
  - Scale-invariance
  - Consistency
- Impossibility Theorem (Kleinberg)
  - No clustering scheme can achieve all three of properties.
