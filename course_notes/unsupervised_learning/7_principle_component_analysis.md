## PCA
- How to determine the principle component?
  - variance: technical term in stats - roughly the "spread" of a data distribution (similar to standard deviation).
  - principle component of a dataset is the direction that has the largest variance
- Maximal variance and information loss
  - projection onto direction of maximal variance minimizes distance 
  from old (higher-dimensional) data point to its new transformed value
