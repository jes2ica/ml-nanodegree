## Reinforcement Learning
- model(T, R) -> planner -> policy(Ï€) [planning]
- transitions(s,a,r,r') -> learner -> policy [reinforcement learning]
- example
  - animal sees a stimulus
  - takes an action
  - gets a reward
  - strengthens the response to this stimulus
- reward maximization
- RL "API"
  - model(T, R) -> planner -> policy
  - transitions(s, a, r, s')* -> learner -> policy
  - transistions -> modeler -> model -> planner -> policy: model-based RL
  - model -> simulator -> transistions -> learner -> policy: RL-based planner
