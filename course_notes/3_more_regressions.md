## More Regressions
- Parametric regression
- K nearest neighbor (KNN)
- Kernal regression (consider weight)
> Is polynomial regression still linear?
  > - Yes 
  > - The space of polynomials is linear in coefficients.
  > - The weights that the model is seeking to learn are still present only in linear form. The features can be any old nonlinear thing we want to feed into the model!
